  abstract =                   {{I}t is well known anodic {T}i{O}2 nanotubes ({ATNT}s) can be obtained by the
   anodization of {T}i foils in fluoride-containing solutions, and the
   nanotube diameter is proportional to the applied voltages. {H}owever, the
   growth kinetics of {ATNT}s and the relationship between structural
   features and anodizing parameters still remain unclear. {C}hallenges
   always remain in the fabrication of {ATNT}s with large diameters due to
   the undesired breakdown event under the high voltage in {NH}4{F} solutions.
   {H}ere, an interesting approach is first proposed to overcome these
   particular challenges. {A} series of constant current anodizing processes
   in fluoride-free {H}3{PO}4 solutions, {NH}4{F} solutions of different
   concentrations (0.7 wt\%, 0.5 wt\% and 0.2 wt \%), and different mixed
   electrolytes containing both {NH}4{F} and {H}3{PO}4, have been compared in
   detail. {A}nd we mainly focused on the influence of the different ratios
   of {NH}4{F} and {H}3{PO}4 on the outer diameters of {ATNT}s and the correlation
   between two types of films. {T}he interesting results show that the
   nanotube diameter greatly increases with {H}3{PO}4 amount in the solutions
   with a given concentration of {NH}4{F}. {I}n contrast, the nanotube length
   decreases with the increase of {H}3{PO}4 amount in the solutions with a
   given concentration of {NH}4{F}. {T}he experimental findings and the undesired
   breakdown phenomenon can be elucidated by the theory of the electronic
   current and ionic current rather than by the field-assisted dissolution.

   were successfully fabricated by electrochemical anodization in ethylene
   glycol-based electrolytes with various {NH}4{F} concentrations. {H}ydrogen
   production by photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a

   voltage. {T}he effect of {NH}4{F} concentration on the morphological

   concentration for 60 min exhibited highest hydrogen evolution of 2.53 m{L}
   h(-1) cm(-2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.39\%. {B}ased on
   the above results and the different current-time curves during
   anodization processes, another series of {T}i{O}2 nanotube arrays samples
   with the equal charge consumption (designated as {T}i{O}2 {N}ts-{EC}) were
   synthesized by controlling the anodization time in electrolytes

   prepared at the same {NH}4{F} concentration for 60 min, hydrogen production

   especially for the sample prepared at 1.25 wt\% {NH}4{F} concentrations.
   {M}oreover, despite the difference of {NH}4{F} concentration in electrolyte,
   the {T}i{O}2 {N}ts-{EC} samples exhibit comparable {PEC} performances. {T}hese

   pore diameters and the thicknesses are successfully grown by three-step
   self-organized anodization in ethylene glycol containing 0.38 wt\% of
   {NH}4{F} and 1.79 wt\% of {H}2{O} at applied potential differences ranging from
   30 {V} to 70 {V} at various electrolyte temperatures. {A} relatively high
   growth speed (about 40 mu m h(-1)) of nanopore arrays is achieved at 30
   degrees {C} under the potential difference of 70 {V}. {T}he morphology and the
   structure of {ATO} layers are directly affected by anodizing conditions,
   especially temperature and potential difference. {I}t was found that the
   oxide thickness and the cell size are linearly dependent on anodizing
   potential difference. {O}n the other hand, the anodizing temperature in
   the range of 10-30 degrees {C} does not affect the cell size in {ATO} films.
   {A}nalyses of the pore diameter, pore circularity and regularity of the
   pore arrangement suggests that nanoporous anodic titania with the best
   pore arrangement can be formed in a controlled manner by anodization
   performed at 50 {V} and 20 degrees {C}. {S}urprisingly, below and above this
   critical potential difference and temperature, pore diameters are
   smaller and obtained {ATO} structures are less regular. {A}t higher
   anodizing temperatures, the regularity of pore arrangement observed at
   the surface and the pore diameter are considerably affected by the
   precipitated hydrous titanium dioxide. ({C}) 2013 {E}lsevier {L}td. {A}ll rights

   aluminium in phosphoric acid solution is investigated. {T}he study employs
   a tungsten tracer layer that is incorporated into the anodic film from
   the aluminium substrate, followed by detection of the tracer by
   transmission electron microscopy and {R}utherford backscattering
   spectroscopy. {D}istortions of the tungsten layer on entry into the film
   and retention of tungsten species in the film are compatible with
   porosity arising mainly from flow of anodic oxide beneath the pore bases
   towards the cell walls. {T}he behaviour is contrary to expectations of a

   equally spaced nanolayers of {T}i-{W} alloy, the volume and composition
   changes accompanying the formation of porous anodic films on titanium in
   0.5 wt \% {NH}(4){F} in glycerol are investigated. {T}he findings reveal
   amorphous films with nanotubes of {T}i{O}(2), containing fluoride ions and
   possibly glycerol derivatives. {T}ungsten and titanium species are lost to
   the electrolyte at differing rates during anodizing, leading to an
   enrichment of tungsten in the film relative to the composition of the
   substrate. {T}he spacing of tungsten-containing bands in the film is
   similar to 2.3 that of the original alloy layers during growth of the
   major pores. {T}he generation of the nanotubes can be explained either by
   field-assisted flow of film material within the barrier layer to the
   pore walls, with cation and anion transport numbers of anodic titania in
   the barrier layer region similar to those of barrier films and with
   field-assisted ejection of {T}i(4+) ions to the electrolyte, or by
   field-assisted dissolution, but with a reduction in cation transport
